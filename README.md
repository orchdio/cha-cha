# Cha Cha

Cha-Cha is a slack bot for converting tracks inside slack channels. The bot will also later be able to convert playlists, auto create playlists for channels and also create analytics like songs shared monthly, classification by genre and more. Inspired by [Paystack Music](https://github.com/PaystackHQ/paystack-music-api).

This is very much WIP and the development is as is, features will be deployed as the need for them arises and time goes on. Contributions really welcome.
